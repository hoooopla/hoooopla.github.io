## Math Section

This section explores mathematical concepts and renders equations using LaTeX and MathJax. You can include both inline and block-level math.

- **Inline math example:**  
  The quadratic formula is \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \).

- **Block math example:**
  $$
    f(x) = \int_{a}^{b} x^2 \, dx
  $$

  - **Euler's Identity:**
    $$
    e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
    $$

  - **Pythagorean Theorem:**
    $$
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2
    $$

  - **Taylor Series Expansion:**
    $$
    e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}
    $$

  You can add more formulas or explanations as needed. Collapsible sections like this help keep posts organized and easy to navigate!
